    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Does the pneumonia vaccine shield you from the coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
        No. The pneumonia vaccine, like other vaccines (pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type B) do not provide
        protection from the COVID-19 virus. This virus is new and different which requires time to create a specific
        vaccine for. Researchers are constantly trying to develop a vaccine to tackle COVID-19 and WHO is providing
        enormous support to make it happen. Even though this vaccine is not effective towards COVID-19, vaccines
        created to provide protection from respiratory diseases are very recommended to keep your health in check.

    <div class="content">
        It has not been confirmed how long the virus can last on objects, but it shares similarities with other types
        of coronavirus. Researchers show that the virus can stay for a few hours until a few days. The duration itself
        can be affected by external factors such as the surface type and temperature. If you feel that a surface may
        be infected, ensure to clean it with a disinfectant. Remember to clean your hands after doing so with
        alcohol-based hand rub or soap with water. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

        Throughout isolation, individuals must follow all the instructions from healthcare workers to minimize the
