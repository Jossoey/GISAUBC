<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I still come back to Canada with my study permit?</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Yes, as long as your study permit and visa is still valid. After your arrival in Canada, you need to be self-quarantined
    for 14 days. You can apply for your visa online or through the Canadian embassy in Jakarta.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What kinds of documents do I need to go back? What is the best way to prepare them?</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>All Indonesian residents who are flying back to Indonesia must provide a health certificate (surat keterangan sehat)
        and provide proof that you are tested negative for COVID-19 with the PCR test, which is valid for 7 days upon your
        arrival in Indonesia.
        <br>We recommend to take the test a week before your departure so that when you receive the results of the test (in 2-3 days),
        it is still valid, it is still valid when you arrive in Indonesia.
        <br>There are two types of tests: PCR and Rapid Test. Rapid test is the test that can give out faster results, but this test
        alone is not enough. The PCR test is the most valid that declares whether or not you are infected by COVID-19 virus. It
        is recommended to take the test in Canada, so you would not have to do the test again in Indonesia. If you decided to take the
        test in Indonesia, you must be quarantined in a separate place for 2-3 days.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Is Health Certificate and PCR the same document?</button>

        test. Furthermore, the health certificate can also include statements sating that you are showing no symptoms of COVID-19,
        further strengthening your eligibility to return to Indonesia safely.
